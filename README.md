# Simple reactjs class for hoverable image
As you know inline css in reactjs component doesn't support providing image for hovered state of <img>

This provided a simple HoverImage react class to support image with hovered state

This sample was being used in Rails with reactjs-rails gem included. Code was written in coffeescript (That is awesome), you can easily convert to javascript if needed
